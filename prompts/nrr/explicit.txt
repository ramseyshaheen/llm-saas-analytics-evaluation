Definition:
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR) for January 2024 measures how recurring revenue from existing customers changes over the month.
- The cohort consists of customers who were active on 2024-01-01.
- NRR includes expansion and contraction but excludes revenue from new customers.
- Customers who fully churn contribute $0 to end-of-period revenue.

Rules:
- Revenue should be calculated using plan-level monthly prices.
- A subscription is active on a date if:
  - start_date <= the date, and
  - end_date is NULL or end_date >= the date.
- Customers may have multiple subscriptions; all active subscriptions should be included.

Please:
1. Write the SQL query to calculate NRR for January 2024.
2. Explain the logic.
3. State any assumptions.
