You are an analytics engineer working with a SaaS dataset and are asked to calculate Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for January 2024.

Available tables:
- subscriptions(subscription_id, customer_id, plan_id, start_date, end_date, status)
- plans(plan_id, plan_name, monthly_price, billing_period)

Business definition:
- MRR represents the recurring subscription revenue attributable to active subscriptions at a specific point in time.
- For January 2024, MRR should be calculated as of 2024-01-01.

Subscription activity rules:
- A subscription contributes to MRR if it was active on 2024-01-01.
- A subscription is active on a date if:
  - start_date is on or before that date, and
  - end_date is either NULL or after that date.
- Subscription status fields may exist but should not override date-based activity logic.

Revenue rules:
- Use plan-level monthly prices to calculate MRR.
- Do not use invoices or payments.
- If a customer has multiple active subscriptions, all should be included.

Please do the following:
1. Describe in plain language how you would identify active subscriptions on 2024-01-01.
2. Write the SQL query to calculate MRR based on that logic.
3. Explain any assumptions or limitations of your approach.
