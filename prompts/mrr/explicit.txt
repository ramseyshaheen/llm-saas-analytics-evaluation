Definition:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for January 2024 is the sum of monthly prices for all subscriptions that were active on 2024-01-01.
- A subscription is considered active on a date if:
  - start_date <= the date, and
  - end_date is NULL or end_date >= the date.
- Revenue should be calculated using plan monthly prices (not invoices).
- Multiple active subscriptions per customer should be included.

Please:
1. Write the SQL query to calculate MRR.
2. Briefly explain the logic.
3. State any assumptions.
