Business framing:
- Logo churn measures customer loss, not revenue loss.
- A customer is considered churned only if they have zero active subscriptions at the end of the period.

Metric definition:
- Cohort = customers active on 2024-01-01.
- End-of-period date = 2024-01-31.
- A subscription is active on a date if:
  - start_date is on or before the date, and
  - end_date is NULL or after the date.

Evaluation rules:
- Churn must be evaluated at the customer level, not the subscription level.
- Customers with any active subscription at the end of the month are NOT churned.
- New customers who were not active on 2024-01-01 must be excluded.

Please do the following:
1. Describe in plain language how you would identify churned customers.
2. Write the SQL query to calculate logo churn.
3. Explain how your query avoids double-counting or misclassification.
